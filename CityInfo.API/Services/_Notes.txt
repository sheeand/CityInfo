ICityInfoRepository - is the contract that our repository implementation must  adhere to

Repository Pattern interface considerations - IEnumerable vs. IQueryable
	

Advantages of using IQueryable

	The consumer of the repository can keep building on an IQueryable. For example, he can add an OrderBy clause or Where clause, etc., possibly before the query is executed.
	When building an API with a huge set of data-shaping possibilities, all requiring different queries, using IQueryable avoids the task of having to write tens or hundreds of methods.

Disadvantages of using IQueryable

	It means that you're leaking persistence-related logic out of the repository (which seems to violate the purpose of the repository pattern)
